# JPN-API


Welcome. I aim to provide free and open access to data to any who want it.

Currently I am focusing on developing this site and fleshing out the Japanese Pokemon API data and allowable queries.

## Join Our Community

Discord and GitHub links are in the footer. I look forward to meeting you!

## Contribute

If you want to contribute to the database, API development, or even Discord moderation, 
please feel free to reach out to me at admin@jpn-cards.com or on Discord.

## Data

Data originates from many sources. One of which who deserves an honorable mention is Kevin at [PKMJP](https://twitter.com/pkm_jp).
